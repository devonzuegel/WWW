    	<h2>About</h2>
    	<p>
    		Some of the greatest impact individuals have on politics is driven by daily purchasing decisions. By patronizing a corporation, one is fueling the company's lobbying and donorship capabilities and is indirectly supporting their political causes. Unfortunately, there is little accessible, digestible information about companies' political contributions for consumers to use to take charge of where their money is spent.
    	</p><p>
    		This web app aims to begin solving this problem. The hope is that, by providing insight on companies' political contributions, this tool can help consumers make informed choices about where their money is going.
