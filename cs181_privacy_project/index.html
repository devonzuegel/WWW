			<h3>Welcome our site</h3>
			<p>This website is the culmination of our work in CS181, Stanford's class on Computers, Ethics, and Public Policy. Our research was inspired by a 2002 study by Stanford students that pointed out privacy policy weaknesses and concerns on campus. Because the web has changed so much over the past decade, we decided to bring the original study up to date.</p>

			<i>by The Stanford Student Computer and Network Privacy Project (2002)</i>
			<p>An interesting finding of the 2002 <a href='http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=504729&amp;picked=prox&amp;cfid=465027073&amp;cftoken=69826990'>study</a> was that Stanford students were overwhelming uninformed about their privacy rights. Major portions of the study focused on recommendations for increasing student, particularly undergrad, awareness on campus. Throughout the project, we framed our research in a way that students could quickly digest the information. While a key goal was to keep our content very accessible, we also provide links to further information for those more interested in the specifics.</p>

			<p>In an interview with <a href='https://acp.stanford.edu/staff/david-behinfar'>David Behinfar, Director of Privacy at Stanford</a>, we learned that privacy is approached very differently in America than in Europe. He said that privacy is effectively a constitutional right in Europe, while in America we have a system of "privacy by design". Instead of inherent privacy rights, it is defined only where we can find a state or federal statute. Instead of a broad, overarching principle applying to all individuals, we have a patchwork system of laws that apply to specific groups in specific circumstances. With this analysis in mind, it is easy to see why there is so little awareness of privacy policies among Stanford students and beyond.</p>

				<div class="accord-content">
					<p>FERPA was signed into US federal law by President Gerald Ford in 1974. It applies to educational institutions that receive funding from the Department of Education. The law gives parents access to their children's records, an opportunity to have records amended, and some control of information from the records. After a student is 18 years old, schools must get receive the student's consent prior to disclosure of his or her education records.</p>
					<p>The University Registrar's site provides a notification of Stanford students' rights afforded under Ferpa. These include:</p>
					<table><tr>
						<td>The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.</li>
						<td>The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.</td>
					</tr><tr>
						<td>The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA.</td>
						<td>The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the date the University receives a request for access.</td>

						<p><b>Privacy Rule:</b> limits Stanford University's use and disclosure of information that could potentially associate an individual's identity with his/her health information</p>
						<p><b>Security Rule:</b> requires Stanford University to implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI (Personal Health Information) maintained in an electronic form ("ePHI") and to protect ePHI against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards, unauthorized uses or disclosures.</p>

However, students with an active SUNETID can change their privacy settings in access.</p>

			<h4>Stanford's Residential Privacy Policy</h4>
			<p>Stanford's <a href='http://acomp.stanford.edu/about/policy'>Residential Privacy Policy</a> states that Academic Computing Services (ACS) collects contact information, including on-campus residence, phone number, email address, and name. The policy states that personally identifiable information is used exclusively to announce security updates and network outages. It also says that ACS will not share personally identifiable information outside of the University unless compelled by court order, subpoena, or emergency circumstances.</p>

			<p>Recently, Stanford's VP for Business Affairs Randy Livingston <a href='http://ucomm.stanford.edu/computersecurity/'>sent a letter</a> to the University community that outlined new security mandates. These requirements included the installation of <a href='https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/bigfix'>BigFix</a>, a program that allows Stanford IT Services to install security patches, to collect information about the computer, and to remotely configure power settings. Among several other requirements, the letter also mandated that all systems must use a University-managed file backup service.</p>

			<p>Soon after the requirements were released, a group of grad students and faculty expressed concerns about the impact of the mandate on individual privacy and research productivity. In particular, they were anxious about giving IT Services administrator privileges through BigFix and the about the file backup service, which would give the University access to files long-deleted by the device's owner. Livingston <a href='http://ucomm.stanford.edu/computersecurity/'>responded with a second letter</a>, suspending the key elements of the mandate for six months while a committee undertakes the mandate's review.

			<h4>Data Classification at Stanford</h4>
			<p>Stanford classifies information under four categories: 
				<a class="tooltip">unrestricted<span class="classic">Information is classified as <b>Unrestricted</b> if it is not considered to be Prohibited, Restricted, or Confidential.</span></a>, 
				<a class="tooltip">confidential<span class="classic">Information is classified as <b>Confidential</b> if (i) it is not considered to be Prohibited or Restricted and is not generally available to the public, or (ii) it is listed as Confidential in the "Classification of Common Data Elements".</span></a>,
				<a class="tooltip">restricted<span class="classic">Information is classified as <b>Restricted</b> if (i) it would otherwise qualify as "Prohibited" but it has been determined by the DGB that prohibiting information storage on Computing Equipment would significantly reducefaculty/staff/student effectiveness when acting in support of Stanford's mission and/or (ii) it is listed as Restricted in the "Classification of Common Data Elements" below.</span></a>, and
				<a class="tooltip">prohibited<span class="classic">Information is classified as <b>Prohibited</b> if protection of the information is required by law/regulation or Stanford is required to self-report to the government and/or provide notice to the individual if information is inappropriately accessed.</span></a>.</p>

			<h2>Student Awareness</h2>
			<p>In order to probe the state of student awareness concerning their privacy rights at Stanford, we conducted a short survey targeting current Stanford undergraduates. From the results of this survey, it appears that Stanford students overall are not very aware of what privacy rights and protections they are guaranteed by both University policy and federal law. Some key results were: </p>
			<table>

				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="images/privacy_importance.png" style="width:100%"/>
					</td><td><p>
						First, we asked respondents how important the issues of privacy and security were to them. The general results were that students care a lot about their privacy and security.
					</p></td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>
						We then decided to ask the same study participants about their knowledge of their privacy rights.
					</td><td>
						<img src="images/security_importance.png" style="width:100%"/>
					</td>

			</tr>


				<tr><td>
					<img src="images/have_you_heard_of_ferpa.png" style="width:100%"/>
				</td><td>
					<p>Only a quarter of respondents had heard of FERPA, the privacy law most relevant to students. Furthermore, those who recognized the acronym were unclear on what the law actually mandates; in response to the question, one student said, "Nope... I just know I signed it in high school or something haha".</p>
				</td></tr>

				<tr><td>
					<p>We also asked students whether or not they believed their parents could access their grades without their permission. The law mandates that parents may only have drirect access to their child's grades if the child is a tax-dependent. Because most undergraduates are tax-dependent, the majority of Stanford students' parents can see their grades; meanwhile, three-quarters of the respondents said they do not believe their parents have access.</p>

		<div class="dark section"> <!-- Moral Frameworks -->
			<a name="our_take"></a>
			<h2>Moral Frameworks</h2>
			
			<p>Privacy laws and policies are created to help protect individuals on information about them. There are many perspectives that privacy policies can be viewed from that can justify or question the necessity of privacy laws and policies such as FERPA, HIPAA, and many more. In relevance with our studies, we will analyze privacy policies from utilitarian and deontological perspectives.</p>

			<p>From a utilitarian perspective, many may argue that privacy policies help to foster and create an environment of trust that allow individuals and the community to freely develop ideas and live in comfort. Granting individual privacy rights can ensure that they feel safe from judgement and thus free to develop ideas that could consequently result in greater good and happiness for both the individual and community. In regards to academic privacy, it is imperative that students not feel pressured that their academic performance be made public. This reassurance benefits students by reducing stress and fear of judgement, creating a better academic environment that fosters honesty and integrity; ultimately benefitting the individual and student body. Although some may argue that privacy is the best interest of the community, a different utilitarian argument may claim that privacy allows for, sometimes crucial, information to be hidden from the public. For example, we can consider the case in which a patient is receiving a life-threatening operation. It would be in ultimate interest of the patient to choose a surgeon who was academically proficient over one who barely passed medical school. While privacy policies may provide individuals reassurance, it may sometimes hide information that would be more beneficial to be public than private.</p>

			<p>From a deontological perspective, it is easy to argue that privacy is simply an inherent human right. Privacy pertains to the actions, information, affairs, reputation, and aspects of an individual. Thus we can argue deontologically that privacy policies are in the duty of enforcing something that belongs to the rights of an individual. In terms of academic privacy, the right to whether parents or legal guardians are allowed to view their child's education records may argued. While a student's academic records certain reflect the properties of a student, we can argue that if a parent is paying for their child's tuition, then they have an inherent right to access their child's records. A deontological argument may claim that parents not only should have the right to inspect the status of their investment, but also have the right as a human to know how their child is performing.</p>

					<p dir="ltr">Stanfords Privacy Policy documentation on the Administrative Guide section of the official website provides an overview and outline of what Stanfords obligations are in regards to students' privacy. It briefly provides descriptions of the rights students have to their personal information such as academic, health, and financial records, as well as the limitations of how Stanford can use its data. In most cases it appears that Stanford's use, disclosure, storage, or collection of student information is fairly limited, and must strictly comply with Federal and state laws. However, in cases where legal action is necessary, Stanford may be required to disclose information about students and/or faculty.</p>

					<p dir="ltr">As an academic institution, Stanford University is required to follow the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) that provides regulation for how academic records for a student are allowed to be disclosed or used. FERPA provides students the right to request and review education records from the University, the right to request changes to education records, and the right to file a complaint with the U.S. department of Education. In addition, FERPA also outlines the ways a student's records may be disclosed without the consent of the student. For example, Stanford is allowed to disclose education records to parents or guardians without the consent of the student as long as they are claimed as a dependent under the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

					<p dir="ltr">Stanford faculty, staff, and students rely heavily on network and Internet access throughout the school. In order to comply with both legal regulations and University policies, Stanford has outlined computer and network usage policies that dictate how and what Stanford's networks are allowed to be used, this includes protection for student information, prohibiting advertising or solicitations, and managing copyright material. In particular, the network usage policy describes how under certain legal circumstances, the university may disclose or review records relating to the use of information services at its discretion. As a result, the policy informs users that users should “not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when using the University's information resources.”</p>

It also discusses disclosure of records to a variety of other parties, including school officials, schools to which a student is transferring, and parties in connection with financial aid to the student. However, this source raises nearly as many questions as it answers; much of the law's phrasing, including the requirement that school officials have "legitimate educational interest", leaves much up for interpretation by the educational institutions themselves.</p>
