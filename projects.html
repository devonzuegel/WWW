				I am currently working on a mobile web app that provides information on the political contributions made by companies. The most important voting is done with your wallet, but there isn't enough accessible information about companies' financial influence on politics for people to make informed decisions. For example, Ben &amp; Jerry's is super anti-gun, while I support gun ownership. I used to buy their brand of ice cream all of the time, because I didn't have easy access to that information. However, as soon as I learned that they contribute a lot of money to the Brady campaign, I moved to different brands.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				When I started brainstorming about this project (the working name is "Paper Trail"), I realized that collecting this information would be a colossal task. I poked around the web a bit and luckily found this awesome database called Influence Explorer, which compiles political fundraising information of many corporations and their executives' personal donations. However, the data isn't presented in any visual, accessible way, and it offers an API for developers to use the information as they please. I would also like to draw info from Wikipedia, and I found a site called dbpedia.org that crawls Wikipedia pages and puts categorical information into a database.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				To the right, you will find a wireframe concept of the application. I'm currently in the stage of learning how to program in Android. When I have a prototype, I will post a screenshot of my progress.
