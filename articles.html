			<h3>+ Why College Campuses Should Allow Concealed Carry</h3><div class="dateTime">January 19, 2013</div>
		</div>
		<div class="accord-content"><div class="leftJustified">
			<p>The news is saturated with stories and opinions on guns, and the attention on the issue is heightened with this past year's dramatic shootings in Aurora and Newtown. Understandably, the response to these horrors involves great emotion. However, in our dialogue about violence and gun ownership, we need to set aside our fears and biases and look at where the facts lead us.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Here in the Bay Area, the general response to gun ownership is an automatic “no,” and the Stanford campus is no exception. Our campus sees minimal violence and our main exposure to firearms is through the news, where killings are stories rather than the cases with peaceful endings.</p>

			<br>

			<p>This anti-gun bias is reflected in campus policy and state law. On its website, Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) states that "all [firearms] are prohibited on Stanford Campus ... except for sworn police officers," and California has mandated absolute firearm bans on all college campuses. These policies assume that guns are fundamentally harmful. Remembering that a weapon is simply a powerful tool that can be used for self-defense as well as for harm, we need to reconsider Stanford's "Gun-Free Zone" policy... <a href = "http://stanfordreview.org/article/why-college-campuses-should-allow-concealed-carry/"><b>Read more</b></a>.</p>

<!-- 			<br>

			<h4>Gun-Free Zones: A monopoly of force</h4>

			<br>
			<br>

			<p>Absolute bans are ineffective, as criminals carry weapons regardless of their legality. Worse, Gun-Free Zones are uniquely attractive targets, as a monopoly of force is in the hands of whoever is willing to break the law, and police response is often too little and too late.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Seung-Hui Cho shot his first two victims at Virginia Tech in 2007, the police unsuccessfully searched for the shooter for two hours. Cho remained in public spaces on campus for that entire time and even went to the post office to mail writings and recordings to NBC News. He then walked to a building of lecture halls at the opposite end of campus, chained the three main entrance doors shut, and killed 30 people in a second attack lasting roughly 10 minutes.</p>

			<br>

			<p>The rampage ended with Cho's suicide. With over 200 rounds left, "he was well prepared to continue," said State Police Superintendent William Flaherty. Unarmed, the victims had no hope but to make barricades and wait for the police to arrive, which happened well after the massacre was over.</p>

			<br>

			<p>The shootings at Columbine and Sandy Hook also ended in the perpetrators' suicide, not police intervention. According to a U.S. Secret Service study into 37 school shootings, “Over half of the attacks were resolved or ended before law enforcement responded to the scene. In these cases, the attacker was stopped by faculty or fellow students, decided to stop shooting on his own, or killed himself.”</p>

			<br>

			<p>It is wrong to disarm an individual when effective protection cannot be provided in compensation, and relying on police officers and security guards has proven to be insufficient. When targets of violence, people have the right to options beyond waiting for help to come... <a href = "http://stanfordreview.org/article/why-college-campuses-should-allow-concealed-carry/">Read more</a>.</p> -->

			<h3>+  An Interview with Dr. Bhattacharya</h3>

			<p><b>
				What is the basic structure of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)?
			</i></b>
			<br>
			<p>
				The big context is that there are about 15 to 16 million uninsured people in the US. People view it as a problem, because there's a lot of financial risk associated with being uninsured, so the ACA aims to expand insurance coverage in two ways. The first is that all people under 138% of the federal poverty line now immediately qualify for Medicaid, while before there were other tests that had to be met. The Congressional Budget Office has said that it'll cover about 13 million people. The second biggest mechanism is probably these insurance exchanges, which are essentially marketplaces where insurance companies can offer health insurance plans that are regulated by the government.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				On top of that basic structure, the ACA puts in place a number of other regulations, the employer and individual mandates being probably the two most well-known. The employer mandate requires all businesses with more than 50 employees to provide health insurance for them. If they don't, they have to pay a penalty, $2-3 thousand per employee. The individual mandate says that if you don't have insurance through Medicaid, through your employer, or some other source, then you're required to buy insurance. If you don't, they there will be a penalty. I guess the Supreme Court calls it a tax. It amounts to about $700 or 2.5% of your income, whichever is more, per year. So those are the basic coverage provisions of the ACA.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The ACA requires insurance companies to accept all clients, including those with pre-existing conditions. Some experts have voiced concerns about eliminating risk from an inherently-risk based market. What are your thoughts on this subject?
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				There are also a bunch of provisions that change what qualifies as an insurance product. Among these include things like you have to provide certain kinds of care. There's an entity called the US Preventative Services Task Force that says if the evidence supports that such-and-such a service is efficacious, then every insurer has to cover it with zero copayment. So for instance, that means that if somebody comes to you, the insurer, and they say, “Hey, I've got diabetes, I've got heart disease, I've got hyper-tension,” you aren't allowed to say, “No, I won't insure you.”
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The way the insurance companies work is that they look at the predicted health costs of a given risk pool and set their premiums based on that. The ACA provisions make it so that it's more expensive to cover this pool, because you have to cover more services and riskier people; in turn, the premiums end up being higher. There's no such thing as a free lunch. You have to pay for these provisions somehow... <a href="http://stanfordreview.org/article/an-interview-with-dr-bhattacharya/"><b>Read more</b></a>.

			<h3>+ Mortgaging the Millennials' Future</h3>
			<br>
			<h4>Obamacare is a lousy deal for young people</h4>
			<div class="dateTime">January 24, 2014</div>
		</div>
		<div class="accord-content"><div class="leftJustified">



			<p>The government spends around $6 on seniors for every dollar it spends on children, according to Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute. There is a growing concern that older generations are committing "generational theft" by leaving behind enormous debt for young people to pay off in the future. Medicare alone has $35.2 trillion of unfunded obligations -- the cost of waging the eight-year Iraq War thirty times -- and spending for the program is expected to surge by 82 percent by 2023 as Baby Boomers continue to age. Furthermore, the benefits -- if any -- that Millennials will receive when we become eligible for Medicare are likely to be far less than what we are forced to pay in as workers. Millennials are projected to become the first generation in US history to have a lower standard of living than their parents. Regina Herzlinger, a professor at Harvard Business School, went so far as to say that Medicare cheats the young. "We're really stealing from them," she claimed. "It's not right."</p>
			<br>
			<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as "Obamacare", is another instance of generational theft. The legislation relies on those who are young and healthy to subsidize older, sicker people, and it's doing so by forcing Millennials to pay for benefits they don't need. Not only is it a direct cost to those young people, but it places a massive opportunity cost on all of society by draining resources from those who will drive our economy for the next generation.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Plans under the ACA are needlessly comprehensive for young people</h4>
			<br>
			<p>Young people tend to be healthy and to have little savings. Consequently, they are more likely than older people to opt for plans that cover only catastrophic circumstances if they buy health insurance at all. However, under the ACA's new regulations, all plans are required to cover with zero copay certain "essential benefits", including alcoholism counseling, diabetes counseling, and maternity services, and these new requirements significantly raise all premiums. On the new exchanges, a 25-year-old non-smoker in California pays $184 per month for the cheapest plan, in contrast to a $92 median cost of the five cheapest plans on HealthInsurance.com in 2013.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Even before the ACA took effect, when the cheapest plans were less extensive and far more affordable, over a quarter of 18- to 30-year-olds decided that it made more financial sense to remain uninsured. Those individuals who thought they would not see a return on investment from even a barebones insurance plan likely wouldn't pay more for wider-ranging plans required under the ACA. For many young people, it simply does not make financial sense to purchase more comprehensive insurance products, since they are unlikely to use enough of the benefits to compensate for the plans' high costs.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Individual mandate dips into the pockets of Millennials to cover costs for older people</h4>
			<br>
			<p>The "community rating laws" and the restriction against denial of service due to pre-existing conditions also raise the cost of premiums disproportionately for young people, despite the group's relatively low health costs.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Pushed by American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) lobbyists, the “community rating laws” prohibit insurers from having an age rating (the pricing ratio between the eldest and youngest beneficiaries in a risk pool) greater than 3:1, although older beneficiaries have on average six times the health expenditures that younger people face. Healthcare policy expert Avik Roy explained, "The net effect of this 'community rating' provision is the redistribution of insurance costs from the old to the young."</p>
			<br>
			<p>The restriction that insurers are no longer allowed to turn away clients due to pre-existing conditions also raises costs by making it more expensive for insurers to cover their pool of beneficiaries, because they now must cover riskier people as well as a broader range services. In turn, this raises premiums for healthcare consumers.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The architects of the ACA realized that young people would have little incentive to participate in the healthcare exchanges and that this would lead to a serious structural problem called “adverse selection”: if the exchanges failed to recruit lots of young, healthy people, the premiums on the market would be extremely high. Thus, lawmakers added the individual mandate requiring all Americans to purchase healthcare. By 2016, the fine for remaining uninsured will ramp up to $695 per person or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater.</p>
			<br>
			<p>“The individual mandate is absolutely necessary if you have a community rating law,” explained Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, an associate professor of Medicine and Economics at Stanford. “The individual mandate is an attempt to address the adverse selection problem [caused by the community rating laws] by essentially forcing people for whom insurance would otherwise be a bad deal to join in.”</p>
			<br>
			<p>Subsidies offered by the federal government offset the cost of insurance for very low-income people. However, most young people are better off on average if they just pay the penalty. A recent study by the National Center for Public Policy Research shows that about 3.7 million of those aged 18-34 will be at least $500 better off if they forgo insurance and pay the penalty, and over 3 million will be $1,000 better off if they go the same route. Opt Out, a campaign organized by the group Generation Opportunity, is urging young people to be wary of signing up for the health care exchanges set up under the ACA and to pay the penalty instead of "purchasing a policy through the Obamacare exchanges that will cost more with no return on investment".</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Low-skilled &amp; low-experience employees will be disproportionately impacted</h4>
			<br>
			<p>ACA perpetuates generational theft beyond redistributing health costs to Millennials through other provisions like the employer mandate. This mandate requires all businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance and imposes a penalty of several thousand dollars per employee that is not covered. A survey by the Chamber of Commerce found that 71 percent of small business owners are finding it harder to make new hires because of this mandate, and young, inexperienced people entering the workforce will bear the brunt of this slowdown.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Businesses are also incentivized to cut the hours of or lay off the least experienced workers, who are often the youngest. Jimmy John's announced that the company plans to cut workers' hours in order to avoid having to offer them health insurance under Obamacare, and many other firms have been forced to act accordingly. "We have to bring them down to 28 hours [per week]," said Jimmy John's CEO. "There's no other way we can survive it."</p>
			<br>
			<p>Furthermore, young people are simply in a poor position to cope with additional costs. Entering the workforce, they generally have low incomes, small savings, and student debt. According to Pew Research, households headed by a senior were 47 times wealthier than those headed by someone under the age of 35. It is unfair to place older, wealthier individuals' healthcare costs on the shoulders of those just starting out in life.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Proponents of the ACA argue that it really is not so unfair, because today's young people are tomorrow's old people. They say that higher costs in the short term will be offset by the provision that raises coverage of children who fall under their parents' plan up to their 26th birthday and when today's young generation grows old. However, Chris Conover of Forbes found that the ACA is not a good deal in the long term; for 22-year-olds, it is "essentially imposing a tax of 13.8% on the lifetime premiums they would otherwise pay".</p>
			<br>
			<h4>There is an opportunity cost of draining young people's income</h4>
			<br>
			<p>It is important to keep in mind that policy does not operate in a vacuum. Every dollar collected in taxes and every mandate levied by legislation has far-reaching effects. As our government increases the financial burden on the young, fewer people will have the resources to start businesses, to expand their human capital through education, to raise a family, or to pursue any other aspiration. These important facets of society will suffer as young people are forced to devote more resources to cross-generational subsidization. If nothing else, government programs such as the ACA require a thriving tax base, a condition that cannot be met if economic growth is stunted by legislation meant to serve short-term aims.</p>
			<br>
			<p>There is no doubt that the United States faces severe healthcare challenges and that reform is necessary. However, when considering the efficacy of the ACA, we need to remember that we are stifling the potential for future growth as we funnel resources away from young people who are just starting out in life.</p>
